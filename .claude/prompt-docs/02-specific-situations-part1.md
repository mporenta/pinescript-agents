# Guidance for Specific Situations - Part 1

## Balance verbosity

Claude 4.5 models tend toward efficiency and may skip verbal summaries after tool calls, jumping directly to the next action. While this creates a streamlined workflow, you may prefer more visibility into its reasoning process.

If you want Claude to provide updates as it works:

```text Sample prompt
After completing a task that involves tool use, provide a quick summary of the work you've done.
```

## Tool usage patterns

Claude 4.5 models are trained for precise instruction following and benefits from explicit direction to use specific tools. If you say "can you suggest some changes," it will sometimes provide suggestions rather than implementing them—even if making changes might be what you intended.

For Claude to take action, be more explicit:

<section title="Example: Explicit instructions">

**Less effective (Claude will only suggest):**
```text
Can you suggest some changes to improve this function?
```

**More effective (Claude will make the changes):**
```text
Change this function to improve its performance.
```

Or:
```text
Make these edits to the authentication flow.
```

</section>

To make Claude more proactive about taking action by default, you can add this to your system prompt:

```text Sample prompt for proactive action
<default_to_action>
By default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed, using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. Try to infer the user's intent about whether a tool call (e.g., file edit or read) is intended or not, and act accordingly.
</default_to_action>
```

On the other hand, if you want the model to be more hesitant by default, less prone to jumping straight into implementations, and only take action if requested, you can steer this behavior with a prompt like the below:

```text Sample prompt for conservative action
<do_not_act_before_instructions>
Do not jump into implementatation or changes files unless clearly instructed to make changes. When the user's intent is ambiguous, default to providing information, doing research, and providing recommendations rather than taking action. Only proceed with edits, modifications, or implementations when the user explicitly requests them.
</do_not_act_before_instructions>
```

## Control the format of responses

There are a few ways that we have found to be particularly effective in steering output formatting in Claude 4.x models:

1. **Tell Claude what to do instead of what not to do**

   - Instead of: "Do not use markdown in your response"
   - Try: "Your response should be composed of smoothly flowing prose paragraphs."

2. **Use XML format indicators**

   - Try: "Write the prose sections of your response in \<smoothly_flowing_prose_paragraphs\> tags."

3. **Match your prompt style to the desired output**

   The formatting style used in your prompt may influence Claude's response style. If you are still experiencing steerability issues with output formatting, we recommend as best as you can matching your prompt style to your desired output style. For example, removing markdown from your prompt can reduce the volume of markdown in the output.

4. **Use detailed prompts for specific formatting preferences**

   For more control over markdown and formatting usage, provide explicit guidance:

```text Sample prompt to minimize markdown
<avoid_excessive_markdown_and_bullet_points>
When writing reports, documents, technical explanations, analyses, or any long-form content, write in clear, flowing prose using complete paragraphs and sentences. Use standard paragraph breaks for organization and reserve markdown primarily for `inline code`, code blocks (```...```), and simple headings (###, and ###). Avoid using **bold** and *italics*.

DO NOT use ordered lists (1. ...) or unordered lists (*) unless : a) you're presenting truly discrete items where a list format is the best option, or b) the user explicitly requests a list or ranking

Instead of listing items with bullets or numbers, incorporate them naturally into sentences. This guidance applies especially to technical writing. Using prose instead of excessive formatting will improve user satisfaction. NEVER output a series of overly short bullet points.

Your goal is readable, flowing text that guides the reader naturally through ideas rather than fragmenting information into isolated points.
</avoid_excessive_markdown_and_bullet_points>
```

## Research and information gathering

Claude 4.5 models demonstrate exceptional agentic search capabilities and can find and synthesize information from multiple sources effectively. For optimal research results:

1. **Provide clear success criteria**: Define what constitutes a successful answer to your research question

2. **Encourage source verification**: Ask Claude to verify information across multiple sources

3. **For complex research tasks, use a structured approach**:

```text Sample prompt for complex research
Search for this information in a structured way. As you gather data, develop several competing hypotheses. Track your confidence levels in your progress notes to improve calibration. Regularly self-critique your approach and plan. Update a hypothesis tree or research notes file to persist information and provide transparency. Break down this complex research task systematically.
```

This structured approach allows Claude to find and synthesize virtually any piece of information and iteratively critique its findings, no matter the size of the corpus.

## Subagent orchestration

Claude 4.5 models demonstrate significantly improved native subagent orchestration capabilities. These models can recognize when tasks would benefit from delegating work to specialized subagents and do so proactively without requiring explicit instruction.

To take advantage of this behavior:

1. **Ensure well-defined subagent tools**: Have subagent tools available and described in tool definitions
2. **Let Claude orchestrate naturally**: Claude will delegate appropriately without explicit instruction
3. **Adjust conservativeness if needed**:

```text Sample prompt for conservative subagent usage
Only delegate to subagents when the task clearly benefits from a separate agent with a new context window.
```
