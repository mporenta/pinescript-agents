# Extended Thinking with Tool Use - Part 2

## Continuing the conversation with tool results

Now let's continue the conversation and use the tool:

### Python Example

```python
# Extract thinking block and tool use block
thinking_block = next((block for block in response.content
                      if block.type == 'thinking'), None)
tool_use_block = next((block for block in response.content
                      if block.type == 'tool_use'), None)

# Call your actual weather API, here is where your actual API call would go
# let's pretend this is what we get back
weather_data = {"temperature": 88}

# Second request - Include thinking block and tool result
# No new thinking blocks will be generated in the response
continuation = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=16000,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 10000
    },
    tools=[weather_tool],
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Paris?"},
        # notice that the thinking_block is passed in as well as the tool_use_block
        # if this is not passed in, an error is raised
        {"role": "assistant", "content": [thinking_block, tool_use_block]},
        {"role": "user", "content": [{
            "type": "tool_result",
            "tool_use_id": tool_use_block.id,
            "content": f"Current temperature: {weather_data['temperature']}°F"
        }]}
    ]
)
```

### TypeScript Example

```typescript
// Extract thinking block and tool use block
const thinkingBlock = response.content.find(block =>
  block.type === 'thinking');
const toolUseBlock = response.content.find(block =>
  block.type === 'tool_use');

// Call your actual weather API, here is where your actual API call would go
// let's pretend this is what we get back
const weatherData = { temperature: 88 };

// Second request - Include thinking block and tool result
// No new thinking blocks will be generated in the response
const continuation = await client.messages.create({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  max_tokens: 16000,
  thinking: {
    type: "enabled",
    budget_tokens: 10000
  },
  tools: [weatherTool],
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: "What's the weather in Paris?" },
    // notice that the thinkingBlock is passed in as well as the toolUseBlock
    // if this is not passed in, an error is raised
    { role: "assistant", content: [thinkingBlock, toolUseBlock] },
    { role: "user", content: [{
      type: "tool_result",
      tool_use_id: toolUseBlock.id,
      content: `Current temperature: ${weatherData.temperature}°F`
    }]}
  ]
});
```

### Final Response

The API response will now **only** include text:

```json
{
    "content": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "Currently in Paris, the temperature is 88°F (31°C)"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Preserving thinking blocks

During tool use, you must pass `thinking` blocks back to the API, and you must include the complete unmodified block back to the API. This is critical for maintaining the model's reasoning flow and conversation integrity.

<Tip>
While you can omit `thinking` blocks from prior `assistant` role turns, we suggest always passing back all thinking blocks to the API for any multi-turn conversation. The API will:
- Automatically filter the provided thinking blocks
- Use the relevant thinking blocks necessary to preserve the model's reasoning
- Only bill for the input tokens for the blocks shown to Claude
</Tip>

<Note>
When toggling thinking modes during a conversation, remember that the entire assistant turn (including tool use loops) must operate in a single thinking mode. For more details, see the Toggling Thinking Modes in Conversations section.
</Note>

## Why preserve thinking blocks?

When Claude invokes tools, it is pausing its construction of a response to await external information. When tool results are returned, Claude will continue building that existing response. This necessitates preserving thinking blocks during tool use, for a couple of reasons:

1. **Reasoning continuity**: The thinking blocks capture Claude's step-by-step reasoning that led to tool requests. When you post tool results, including the original thinking ensures Claude can continue its reasoning from where it left off.

2. **Context maintenance**: While tool results appear as user messages in the API structure, they're part of a continuous reasoning flow. Preserving thinking blocks maintains this conceptual flow across multiple API calls. For more information on context management, see our [guide on context windows](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows).

**Important**: When providing `thinking` blocks, the entire sequence of consecutive `thinking` blocks must match the outputs generated by the model during the original request; you cannot rearrange or modify the sequence of these blocks.
